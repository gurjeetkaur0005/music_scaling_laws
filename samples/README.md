# Audio Samples

This folder contains audio and MIDI samples generated by the **best-performing
Transformer model** for qualitative evaluation.

The samples demonstrate both unconditional generation and conditional
generation initialized with a short musical prefix.

## Samples Included

- **transformer_unconditional.mp3**  
  Unconditional music generated by the best Transformer model

- **transformer_conditional.mp3**  
  Conditional music generation initialized with a short prefix

- **Corresponding MIDI files (.mid)**  
  MIDI versions of the generated samples before conversion to audio

## Generation Process

All samples were generated by:
1. Sampling symbolic music in ABC notation from the trained Transformer model
2. Converting ABC files to MIDI format
3. Converting MIDI files to MP3 for easy playback
