# Audio Samples

This folder contains audio and MIDI samples generated by the **best-performing
Transformer model** for qualitative evaluation.

The samples include both conditional and unconditional generations produced
after training the final model.

## Samples Included

### Conditional Samples
- **conditional_1.mp3** – Conditional generation with a short musical prefix  
- **conditional_3.mp3** – Conditional generation with a short musical prefix  
- **conditional_4.mp3** – Conditional generation with a short musical prefix  

### Unconditional Samples
- **unconditional_3.mp3** – Unconditional music generation  
- **unconditional_4.mp3** – Unconditional music generation  

### MIDI Files
- Corresponding `.mid` files are also included for each sample, representing
  the output before conversion to audio.

## Generation Process

All samples were generated by:
1. Sampling symbolic music in ABC notation from the trained Transformer model
2. Converting ABC files to MIDI format
3. Converting MIDI files to MP3 for easy playback
